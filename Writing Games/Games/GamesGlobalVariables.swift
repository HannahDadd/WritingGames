                          Sirens wail. Her voice whispers. “Will I…”
                          “What?” The questions tinge with urgent fear. Don’t die. Please, don’t die.
                          A slim tongue wets dry lips. Glassy eyes widen. A strangled breath. “Don’t let me die. P-please.”
                          Words choke me. Salty tears drip across my cheeks. I suck in cold air, a response caught somewhere in my throat. Her face is earnest. Open. Pale. Waiting. Hoping. Begging.
                          “You’ll… they’re coming… You’re…” Something pushes at my shoulder. Her mouth goes slack. The tension slips from her face. Flashes of red and blue flick across her glassy eyes.
                          No. No, I’m standing. Fingers are tugging at my jumper. Instructions are barked in my ear. When did I move? When did they arrive?
                          Dead. She’s dead.

                          The incandescent glow of the street lamps keeps the hungry night at bay. The pavement is barren. Blanketed by fear’s intoxicating chill. My heart hammers. Something is about to happen. Something bad. A sickening wave of panic crashes through me. Dizzying terror climbs up my spine.
                          Someone else should be here.
                          The realisation hits me. I shouldn’t be alone.
                          I spin, boots scraping unyielding cement. The pavement is distorted. Wrong. The library lustre paints the darkness. Windows catch tilting reflections. I dance on glassy panes. Pale. Broken. Alone. Brick walls hide in shadow.
                          There’s a cement building in front. I’ve been here before. I’m missing something… I need something… There. That window. I need that window. Why? My vision narrows.
                          I know what’s going to happen.
                          I’ve seen this before.
                          I am powerless to stop it.
                          The window explodes. A rain of glass falls around a dark shape within. My heart hammers. The body plummets. Cream gilet. A cascade of blonde curls ballooning around a pale face.
                          “No!” The scream rips from my mouth. I charge across the road, a cacophony of frantic limbs and shallow breaths. “Please, no!” My throat is raw, But I know I'm powerless to stop her death.

                          Heather spreads out a rug, patched in red and white. She pulls out strawberries and cakes and crisps and bread sticks and layers them across the soft wool.
                          Russell stops short. “You… made a picnic?”
                          Heather lifts one shoulder in a shrug, cherry lip pinched between her teeth. “I wanted to rival your last date.”
                          He breathes a laugh. Their last date had been in the students union cinema. They’d seen Brother Bear, Heather’s favourite film, thanks to Mark who was on the committee of students who chose the films. He’d brought the tickets and she’d gasped when the title had been splashed across the big screen. It had taken him quite a bit of planning.
                          “I’m glad you enjoyed it.” He slides onto the rug next to her. She’s even made fairy cakes, with sugared hearts on top.
                          “I can’t believe you remembered my favourite film.” She leans her head against his shoulder. Her shampoo is scented like apples, strands of her golden hair flicking across his jaw.
                          “I was quite surprised.” The night she’d told him had involved several pints, two massive burgers and a very poor attempt at darts. She’d come back to his room in halls and they spoke into the small hours, curled together and trading tidbits and dreams until they fell asleep.
                          She scoots closer to him on the blanket and curls into his side. It’s like she was made to fit there. “Do you like it?”

                          The grass had shrunk to withered husks, the weeds brittle and brown. The world was curling in the summer heat, crunching beneath my trainers. The flower stems were clammy in my palms. Nat hugged her elbows, as if she were cold, her legs crossed at the ankles, her bottom lip caught between her teeth. The grave. A tree nearby. The lumpy stone church.
                          I didn’t cry. I was done crying.
                          I bent to the grass, bare knees scraping dry earth, and dropped the flowers to the still stone. I should say something. Sorry? I wish I had been better? You shouldn’t be here? Nothing felt right.
                          I tugged my shorts down my thighs and squinted at the name etched into stone. Nat wove her fingers through mine, sweaty palm to sweaty palm. I won’t cry, I told my misted eyes and pressed my parched lips together. Tears don’t bring back the dead.
                          “She shouldn’t have died.” Nat said.
                          I nodded. Blinked. The words stuck to my throat, the impossibilities and the truth.
                          Her clammy fingers squeezed mine. I don’t know how long we stood. How long it took me to say goodbye.

                          Rain is thrust against the windscreen. A torrent runs like a river down the smooth glass. The windscreen wipers work in a pointless frenzy. I sit in the front seat, hands gripping soft cotton, heart thumping as loud as the pounding winds outside.
                          I refuse to meet my untimely end in a car crash minutes before saving my sister. I’ve survived so much. Nat’s knuckles are blanched white where she grips the steering wheel. She’s leaning forward, head tilted close to the glass. The car fans wage war against our soggy breaths, mingling in the metal prison.

She untucks her brown curls from the tight bun and smooths out the creases. She loses the denim jacket, too. Pulls on a thick hoodie and drops the ridiculous sunglasses into her bag, next to her school planner.

                            Rick’s night started out ok. He’d been in a pub, surrounded by the scent of beer and the trickling beat of some nineties pop tunes. The girl he’d met online had been fine. Kind. Pretty. They’d left well before it was closing, him having nursed a pint and a salad, her having eaten a burger.
                            “Do you mind?” She pulls a pack of cigarettes from her leather purse. He nods, because what else would he say. She offers him one but he declines.
                            The smell of smoke fills the air, at odds with the trickling scent of her perfume. It billows between her painted lips. He says nothing. He jams his hands in his pockets and continues their small talk.
                            He didn’t like the woman, even before she pulled out the cigarette. In truth, he hadn’t come here to find the girl of his dreams, more to check that she wasn’t her.  She’s better than his last online date though. The last girl had left her wallet at home and insisted he pay. Like pHd students are loaded, or something. The man before that suggested skipping dinner altogether and just meeting at his place. Rick was pretty sure that was just a hookup.
                            This woman had been pleasant enough. Talkative. Interesting. She just isn’t the right person. They wait at the bus stop together, her smoking, him freezing. She turns to him, a playful smile pulled on her round face. “Do you want to come back to my place?”

                            At least, that’s what she tells herself. Desperate, right? Mouths to feed (well, hers and maybe her ungrateful boyfriend who is out sofa surfing while waiting on his band’s big break). And besides, who said it would be used for murder? It’s probably an heirloom or something. An old treasure.

Despite the ski mask and baggy black clothing, goosebumps prick her skin and winter’s chill strokes the back of her neck. Urg, why does no one hire her for these big jobs in the country in Spring? Or summer? No, not summer. She’s done the ski mask thing in summer before. Never again. The lock clicks and the door swings wide.

                            “Yeah. I do. I love writing. It’s my favourite… thing.” I shift the battered copy of War and Peace in my fingertips, brought from the charity shop for 20p this morning.
                            “What genre?” His blonde eyebrows furrow beneath a thinning hairline.
                            “Classics. I write classics.” I twist the book in my palm so War and Peace’s shiny, dented cover catches the light. Classics is a genre right? The frown he’s giving me suggests otherwise. I jerk my head towards the seminar room. “I’m going to find a seat.”
